echo Thanks to the generosity of some of the original creators of the classic games that MAMEÂ® can emulate,
echo several games have been released for free, non-commercial use.
echo It is our hope that in the future, we will be able to add more games to this list.
echo
echo Note: The ROMs on these pages have been approved for free distribution on this site only.
echo Just because they are available here for download does not entitle you to put them on your own site,
echo include them with your own distributions of MAME, or bundle them with your software, cabinet, or other item.
echo To do that, you must obtain permission from the original owners.
